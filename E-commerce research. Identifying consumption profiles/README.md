# E-commerce research. Identifying consumption profiles

## Objectives
- segmenting customers based on their purchase history
- development of individual recommendations to increase sales for each customer segment

## Summary workflow
1. Analyzed the overall performance of the store and identified problem areas.  
2. Categorization of the store's goods was made in order to further determine the patterns in the segments.  
3. Customers of the store are divided into 4 segments based on RFM analysis.  
4. Hypotheses were hypothesized and tested, confirming that each segment is unique and different from the other segments.  
5. Features in the interaction of each customer segment with the store were identified.  
6. Specific recommendations for improving the interaction with each segment were given

## Techniques used
Data cleaning, visualization, A/B test, RMF analysis, Mann-Whitney test

## Tools
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy, Seaborn, pymorphy2)
